    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Courtney. I grew up on Long Island and went to the University at Albany for my degree. I received a degree in psychology and sociology. After graduating I was not sure what I wanted to do next and was about to get a job at a tech company called Datto. I have worked in support for the past 2 years and I am ready to further my career in the technology industry. I believe that learning how to code for software development is the next logicial step in my career.</p>
